## Service Communication

Services communicate with each other through:

- gRPC (for internal service communication)

## Technology Stack

- ASP.NET/C#
- Spring Boot/Java
- Golang
- PostgreSQL (main database)
- Redis (caching)
- MongoDB
- MinIO/S3 (file storage)
- RabbitMQ (message broker)
- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)
- Envoy Proxy (API Gateway)
- Grafana/Prometheus (Logging monitoring)
- GraphQL
- WebSocket

## Development Guidelines

1. Each service should be independently deployable
2. Services should follow the same coding standards and patterns
3. Each service should have its own database schema
4. Services should implement proper error handling and logging
5. All services should include comprehensive unit and integration tests
6. Services should implement proper monitoring and health checks
7. Documentation should be maintained for each service
8. All database migrations for the Auth Service must be created in the folder `src/auth/AuthService.Infrastructure/Persistence/PostgreSQL` and should follow best practices for migration scripts (clear naming, idempotency, and proper rollback support).

   To create a new migration using EF Core, run the following command from the project root:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project src/auth/AuthService.Infrastructure --startup-project src/auth/AuthService.API --output-dir Persistence/PostgreSQL
   ```

   Replace `<MigrationName>` with a descriptive name for your migration.
